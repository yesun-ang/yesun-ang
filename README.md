## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Yesun (pronounced yay-sun)! I'm seeing full-time roles or internship opportunities in software engineering or machine learning. I'm a fourth year undergraduate at Rutgers University pursuing a B.S in computer science and a B.A in data science. I'm also participating in an 18-month program at Cornell Tech which focuses on machine learning and data science, utilizing python and packages such as scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy. 

I'm passionate about leveraging technology to better the world, and my end goal is to make impactful contributions that will make a difference. I'm looking forward to connecting with like-minded CS peers, industry professionals, and potential mentors!
